## ‚öôÔ∏è **Challenges and Solutions**
### 1. **Handling NULL Values**
- **Challenge:** Joins involving missing data returned incomplete results.  
- **Solution:** Used `COALESCE()` to replace NULL values with default values, ensuring complete data retrieval.  

### 2. **Query Performance Optimization**
- **Challenge:** Slow performance for large datasets.  
- **Solution:** Applied `INDEX` on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.  

### 3. **Date Range Management**
- **Challenge:** Difficulty in filtering data by specific time periods.  
- **Solution:** Used `BETWEEN` for easy filtering by date range.
